# Costa Rican Black Bean Dip (Frijoles Molidos)

## Ingredients
- 2 large cans (26.5 ounces / 751 grams) of black beans.
- 1 tablespoon of chicken bouillon (or 1 cube)
- 3 tablespoons of Salsa Lizano ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Lizano-Salsa-Sauce-23-7/dp/B078FHCJG7/ref=sr_1_4) or your [neighborhood latino grocery](https://www.bonitomichoacanmarket.com/home))
- 3 tablespoons of Ketchup
- 1 tablespoon of sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt (more to taste after mixing)
- 1/4 stick of butter
- 1/2 of a smallish onion (too big, too oniony)
- 1/2 of a red pepper
- 1/2 of a bundle of fresh cilantro
 
## Directions

Drain and rinse the beans. You want them as dry as you can get them so your bean dip isn't watery and soupy.

Throw everything into a food processor and process until you have a nice, smooth bean-dip texture. 

Test with a chip. Add salt if needed. But, that's it. I like to serve it just a touch warmer than room temperature.

NOTE: This bean dip is awesome with [patacones](https://www.mycolombianrecipes.com/fried-green-plantains-patacones/). Just sayin'.
