# Apple Cake

## Ingredients: Apple Prep
- 5 Granny Smith apples (normal, not huge or tiny)
- 2/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1/3 cup brown sugar

## Ingredients: Cake
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup vegetable oil
- 1 1/2 (1.5) cups granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 3 whole eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup walnuts or pecans, coarsely chopped (optional)

## Ingredients: Glaze
- 3/4 cup butter
- 3/4 cup brown sugar
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup heavy (whipping) cream
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Directions

Peel and chop your apples (I use a [peeler](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000DZ16W/); color me lazy) and place them in a bowl. Mix the two sugars together and sprinkle it on your cubed/chopped apple pieces. Cover it and let it sit in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Yes, do this. You'll need to drain the water before you mix your apples with the cake batter.

Preheat your oven. I bake mine in a convection oven at 325°F. Try 350°F in a non-convenction "normal" oven (just watch the edges; if they get too dark, cover with foil or test with a toothpick to see if it's done). The rack in the oven should be in the middle, or on the notch just above the middle.

Mix flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a medium bowl. Make sure it is mixed well and there are no clumps. Sift it twice if you want. Set aside.

In the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, mix the vegetable oil with both sugars until well mixed.

With the mixer running, add one egg at a time. Once mixed, add the vanilla. Mix and scrape the sides until well combined and smooth.

Slowly, with the mixer on low, add the dry ingredients (the flour, etc. in the medium bowl you set aside above). Scrape the sides of the bowl and mix well.

Remove your apples from the fridge. Use a slotted spoon (or some other type of strainer) to pull the apples out of the bowl. Do NOT just dump it into the mix; the apples shed water and that extra liquid will make a sugary puddle out of your fine apple cake. Fold the apples into your cake batter. Do it by hand, not with the mixer. You don't want to make apple sauce. You want apple pieces. Be nice; be gentle.

OPTIONAL (because I'm not a huge fan of nuts in my dessert, but they're not bad in this cake): Fold the walnuts or pecans into the cake batter.

Grease a 9x13 pan. Or, even better: line your 9x13 pan with a parchment paper sling ([example](https://mintandmallowkitchen.com/how-to-line-a-loaf-pan/)). Spray the sling with non-stick spray. 

Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes (that's 75 minutes), turning it 180° degrees after about 35 or 40 minutes. 

When the cake is done and out of the oven, prep your glaze. Put all the glaze ingredients into a small sauce pan (a pot) and bring it to a boil, stirring constantly. Once it reaches a boil, stir continuously for 1 minute. Remove it from the heat and pour it over the top of the warm cake. You may have to get just a wee bit creative to fit it all on there (poke some holes if you need to), but it all needs to go on there. You can do it.

Let the glazed apple cake cool for a bit so it holds together better.
