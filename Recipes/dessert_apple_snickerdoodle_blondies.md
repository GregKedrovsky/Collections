# Apple Snickerdoodle Blondies

This recipe originally called for an 8x8 pan. That's not nearly enough. So... I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan.

## Ingredients
- 2 cups of tart apples, peeled and chopped (about 3 Granny Smiths)
- Cinnamon sugar to sprinkle on the chopped apples: 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon


- 1/2 cup room temperature butter
- 2 cups light brown sugar, packed


- 2 eggs
- 2 teaspoon vanilla extract


- 2 cups of all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt


- 4 tablespoons granulated sugar (for topping)
- 3 teaspoons ground cinnamon (for topping)

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 350° and line your 9x13 pan with a foil or parchment paper sling ([example](https://mintandmallowkitchen.com/how-to-line-a-loaf-pan/)). Spray the sling with non-stick spray. (I baked these in a non-convection "normal" oven at 350°F.)

Peel and chop the apples. Sprinkle them with the cinnamon sugar; toss and coat them very lightly. Set aside. 

In your mixer, whip together your butter and brown sugar until light. Add the eggs and vanilla and mix well. Add the mixture of flour, baking powder, and salt; mix until just combined. Remember to scrape the sides of your bowl with a rubber spatula to get things mixed well.

Add (fold in) the chopped apples at the very end and stir by hand into the mixture. Use a slotted spoon to move the apples from their current bucket to the mix so you don't dump in all the water the apples shed.

Press the mix into your prepared pan. Slightly damp, clean hands work best for this. A large metal spoon works well, too.

Topping: Mix the cinnamon and sugar together and sprinkle over the top.

Bake for 45-50 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. I did mine for 50 minutes (non-convection "normal" oven at 350°F).

Cool and serve.
