# Apple Snickerdoodle Blondies

This recipe originally called for an 8x8 pan. That's not nearly enough. So... I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan.

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup room temperature butter
- 2 cups light brown sugar, packed
- 2 eggs
- 2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups of all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups of tart apples, peeled and chopped (about 3 Granny Smiths)
- 4 tablespoons granulated sugar (for topping)
- 3 teaspoons ground cinnamon (for topping)

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 350Â° and line your 9x13 pan with a foil or parchment paper sling ([example](https://mintandmallowkitchen.com/how-to-line-a-loaf-pan/)). Spray the sling with non-stick spray.

Peel and chop the apples. Sprinkle them with some brown sugar, sugar, and cinnamon to coat them very lightly. Set aside. 

In your mixer, whip together your butter and brown sugar until light. Add the eggs and vanilla and mix well. Add the mixture of flour, salt, and baking powder; mix until just combined.

Add (fold in) the chopped apples at the very end and stir by hand into the mixture. Use a slotted spoon to move the apples from their current bucket to the mix so you don't dump in all the water the apples shed.

Press the mix into your prepared pan. Slightly damp, clean hands work best for this. 

Mix the cinnamon and sugar together and sprinkle over the top.

Bake for 25-30 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. I did mine for about 35-40 minutes (using a convection oven at 325 degrees).

Cool and serve.
