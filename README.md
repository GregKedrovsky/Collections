### You Need a Goal (Jordan Peterson)

Source: https://youtu.be/uwQp-mLD3oc

Positive emotion is analgesic: it actually quells pain. It's not just postive. It also gets rid of negative.

Almost all the positive emotion that you're going to feel will be in relationship to a goal. Because you feel positive emotion as you approach a goal. And so if you want to feel positive emotion, then you need a goal. 

And then you might think that, well if you want to maximize that positive emotion, which is enthusiasm and also what pulls you out into the world, as well as feeling good... then you need the best possible goal. Because that's going to engage the largest segments of your being. Because if your goal is too narrow, then a bunch of you is not going to be on board for it. But if the goal is well developed and multi-faceted, then all of you can partake in it, even you negative elements--even your anger and your fear can get on board with that.

So you need a goal. You need a goal that justifies the tragedy and malevolence of life.
