## Intro: Terms & Concepts

### Miscellany
- **Book:** [American Kingpin](https://www.amazon.com/American-Kingpin-Criminal-Mastermind-Behind/dp/1591848148/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0) by Nick Bilton
- **Note:** Bitcoin is traceable, and anonymity can be broken.

### Money
- Defined (wikipedia): legal tender in a country (and crypto is not that, yet)
- Key Components for Money to be Money:
  1. Medium of Exchange: to be able to compare values of dissimilar objects.
  2. Unit of Account: money acts as a standard of measure--a common denomination of trade
  3. Store of Value: it can be saved, retrieved, and exchanged at a later time; predictable

### Fiat Currency
- Currency without intrinsic value that is established as money, often by government regulation. Assigned a value... exchanging parties agree to its value...

### Virtual Currency
- A medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not have all the attributes of real currency. In particular, virtual currency does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction (except in El Salvador).

**Convertible Virtual Currency:** open currency, can be exchanged back and forth for real fiat currency (e.g., Monero, Bitcoin, Dash, DogeCoin, LiteCoint, Etherium)

**Non-Convertible Virtual Currency:** closed currency, cannot be exchanged into fiat currency (e.g., rewards cards/programs, video game currency); designed to be used within a closed program (like Marriot, airlines reward system; you can "spend" the currency in that closed environment).

### Centralized
- Currency that has a single administrative authority (one entity controlling the system)

### Decentralized
- Currency that does not have any central authority (crypto currency; open-source; peer-to-peer currency; math-based)
- Therefore, "crypto-currency" is decentralized because it is math based).

### Tokens
- Crypto tokens are cryptocurrency tokens. Cryptocurrencies or virtual currencies are denominated into these tokens, which reside on their own blockchains.
- Crypto coins have their own network
- Tokens reside on a particular platform or existing blockchain

**Note:** A "token" often refers to any cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin and Ethereum (even though they are also technically tokens). Because Bitcoin and Ethereum are by far the biggest two cryptocurrencies, it's useful to have a word to describe the universe of other coins.

**Category #1:** Utility Tokens: unregulated and high risk of scam

**Category #2:** Security Tokens: heavily regulate, value tied to a company itself

### Stable Coins
A subset of cryptocurrency, attempts to offer stability
- USD Coin, Dai, Tether, TrueUSD, Gemini Dollar
- Backed by Crypto, Commodity, Fiat, or a combo
- **PROS:** borderless, fast, public ledger system
- **CONS:** centralized, audios, lower ROI growth

### Currency Exchanges
Online platforms to exchange one currency to another, and to fiat also
- CoinBase (be familiar with this; sign up to see how it works)
- BitStamp (based in UK)
- Binance.com (French-based); Binance.US
